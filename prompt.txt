Act as a Senior Backend Engineer. Build a FastAPI MVP for "OSLI: Open Source License Intelligence API". 

### CORE TECH STACK:
- Framework: FastAPI (Python)
- HTTP Client: HTTPX (for async registry calls)
- AI: Google Generative AI (Gemini Flash)
- Data: Local 'licenses.json' (SPDX License List)
- Validation: Pydantic

### DATA LOADING:
- On startup, the app must load 'licenses.json' (downloaded from https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data/blob/master/json/licenses.json) into a global dictionary for O(1) lookups.

### ENDPOINTS TO IMPLEMENT:

1. POST /v1/compatibility-check:
   - Input: { "license_a": "MIT", "license_b": "GPL-3.0" }
   - Logic: Compare against a hardcoded 'Compatibility Matrix' for the top 10 licenses (MIT, Apache-2.0, GPL-2.0, GPL-3.0, BSD-3-Clause, AGPL-3.0, LGPL-3.0, MPL-2.0). 
   - Output: Boolean 'compatible' and a 'reason' string.

2. POST /v1/analyze:
   - Input: { "package_name": "ffmpeg", "context": "SaaS startup" }
   - Logic: 
     a) Use HTTPX to fetch the license from the NPM registry (https://registry.npmjs.org/{package_name}).
     b) Pass the license and user context to Gemini Flash.
     c) Prompt Gemini to return a structured JSON with: { "risk_score": 0-100, "summary": "string", "warnings": [] }.

3. POST /v1/audit:
   - Input: { "dependencies": ["react", "lodash", "express"] }
   - Logic: Loop through dependencies, fetch their licenses via NPM API, and return a list of { "package": "name", "license": "ID", "status": "SAFE/WARN" }.

4. POST /v1/search:
   - Input: { "query": "Chart library for closed source" }
   - Logic: Use Gemini Flash as a 'Smart Search'. It should suggest 3 libraries, their typical licenses, and why they fit the query.

### OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Write a single, clean 'main.py' file.
2. Include a 'requirements.txt' file.
3. Write a 'DOCUMENTATION.md' file in Markdown. It must include:
   - Setup instructions.
   - Example 'curl' commands for every endpoint.
   - A brief explanation of why this API is better than a generic Google search (deterministic data + AI context).

### SAFETY:
- Use environment variables for the Gemini API Key.
- Add basic error handling for 404s (package not found).
